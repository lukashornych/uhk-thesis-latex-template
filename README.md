# UHK thesis Latex template

This is an unofficial Latex version of [UHK](https://www.uhk.cz/) thesis template written in docx. This template is based on 
[xdobro4/uhk-thesis-latex-template](https://github.com/xdobro4/uhk-thesis-latex-template)
which already provided great start for thesis (thanks!). Unfortunately, some aspects of the template had to be reworked or modified to match it 
with the official MS Word template styling and all content requirements.

## How to start writing

1. install Latex (e.g. [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/))
2. install Latex editor (e.g. [IntelliJ Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) with [TeXiFy IDEA](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9473-texify-idea) plugin)
3. open this template with the editor
4. try to build it with pdfLatex
    - if there is some problem, you have probably installed or configured the TeX or pfdLatex incorrectly 
5. if success resolve all of the `TODO WRITER:` todos and write your thesis ðŸ™‚
